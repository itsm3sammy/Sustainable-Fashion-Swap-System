# 👕 SwapThreads

**SwapThreads** is a terminal-based Python application that promotes sustainable fashion through a community-driven clothes swapping system. Users can register, login, add clothes, borrow items, and return borrowed clothes — all from the command line.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Register and login system (credentials stored persistently)
- ✅ Add clothing items to the shared wardrobe
- ✅ Borrow available items with full details
- ✅ Return borrowed items easily
- ✅ Persistent data storage via `items.json` and `users.json`
- ✅ Clean command-line UI with boxed menus

## 💡 How It Works

- **Topwear and Bottomwear** are modeled as object-oriented classes with attributes like brand, size, and color.
- **Users** (Swap Members) can manage their borrowed items.
- The **SwapSystem** handles the logic for all users and clothing items.
